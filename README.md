# Siamese Network Code Implementation from Scratch (Keras)

This repository contains an implementation of a **Siamese Neural Network** from scratch using **Keras**. The Siamese Network is primarily used for **one-shot learning**, **face recognition**, **signature verification**, and **similarity detection** tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- **Pairwise Similarity Learning**: Learn to distinguish between similar and dissimilar image pairs.
- **Custom Data Pipeline**: Efficient data loading and preprocessing.
- **Contrastive Loss Function**: Used for training the network effectively.
- **End-to-End Training**: Train and evaluate the model from scratch.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- OpenCV / PIL (for image processing)
