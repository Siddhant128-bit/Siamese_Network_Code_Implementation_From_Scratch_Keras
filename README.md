Siamese Network Code Implementation from Scratch (Keras)

Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of Siamese Networks from scratch using Keras. Siamese Networks are commonly used for tasks such as facial recognition, signature verification, and other applications requiring similarity comparison between pairs of inputs.

Features

Implements Siamese Networks using Keras and TensorFlow.

Custom loss function for contrastive learning.

Supports training and evaluation on paired datasets.

Visualization of embeddings to analyze feature similarity.

Installation

To run this implementation, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib

Usage

1. Prepare Your Dataset

Ensure your data is in a format suitable for pairwise comparison.

Label pairs as similar or dissimilar.

2. Run the Training Script

python train.py

3. Evaluate the Model

python evaluate.py

Model Architecture

The model consists of twin networks with shared weights.

Each branch extracts features using convolutional layers.

A distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) is computed to determine similarity.

Results

The model learns to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs effectively.

Can be fine-tuned for various one-shot learning tasks.

Future Improvements

Experimenting with different distance metrics.

Adding support for few-shot learning.

Improving generalization on unseen data.
